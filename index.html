          <p>
            A flash mob is when a group of people arrange to show up at the same
            place, ideally in high numbers. There are different kinds, but I
            participated in and then was a choreographer and coordinator of a
            few dozen mobs over 5 or 6 years.

          <h4>Marriage Proposal Mob - (Glee Flash Mob) - 2012</h4>
          <p>
            This is the 3rd annual Glee Flash Mob that took place in Seattle in
            2012. We put out a message a few months before asking whether there
            was anyone who would be interested in using a flash mob as a
            proposal. The boyfriend of a long-time mobber, Emily, reached out
            and the plan was hatched.
          </p>
          <p>
            During flash mob practices, we said that there would be a special
            guest and teased different celebrities, just saying that they'd
            finally see who it was once everyone turned to the center and
            crouched. It was no celebrity waiting there, but Tim. She said yes,
            by the way, and they were eventually married on the same spot.
          </p>
          <p>

          <h4>Final Glee Mob - 2014</h4>
          <p>
            For the fifth and final Glee Flash Mob, Beth Meberg and I, the
            choreographers, decided to just start the mob ourselves. Many of the
            dancers who joined just after that were from a dance group I danced
            (part-time) with for 10 years, Splinter Dance Company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of this choreography was from previous Glee Mobs and I wasn't
            responsible for the choreo of the first two years.

          <h4>Glee Mob Year 2 - 2012</h4>
          <p>
            I didn't actually participate in the choreography for this flash
            mob, though I do still appear in it. Like the other Glee Mobs, you
            can see me in orange.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm including it here to round out the look of three. I have several
            other mobs that I did choreograph, but they wouldn't embed (or they
            are not worth highlighting, smiley face).

                    One of the best dance photos of me. I had to work it hard to
                    get accepted into the group who started this mob.

                    A shot of only <span class="fst-italic">part</span> of this
                    mob. I believe that there were 800-900 mobbers at this

                    The Glee mobs all ended with everyone holding up a
                    "L"-shaped hand shape. This was a gimmick of the show, Glee,
                    that we always made sure to include.

                    This was probably the least popular song in any of the Glee
                    mixes, "Let's Have a Kiki". It looked really group on a
                    group of 1,000, though.

                    in 50s outfits.
